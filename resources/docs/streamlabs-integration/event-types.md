This page will give you detailed information about all of the available event types. Event types are specified in the `action` field of any action and determine which Streamlabs event (for example gifted youtube memberships or a twitch donation) will trigger that action:
```yaml
  example_reward:
    enabled: true
    action: (Event type)
    ...
```

## Placeholders
Depending on the event type, you can use different **placeholders** in the rest of the action configuration. Those placeholders include things like the donated amount of money, donation message and the donator. Placeholders are always written in this format:
```yaml
"Normal text with a {placeholder}"
```
The `{placeholder}` gets entirely replaced by the value of that placeholder at the time of action execution.
Note that [**PlaceholderAPI placeholders**](https://github.com/PlaceholderAPI/PlaceholderAPI) are also supported in all places where Streamlabs placeholders can be used!

### Placeholders for every event type
The following placeholders are available on every event:
- **user**: The user related to the event

There are some placeholders that are considered to be **internal**, meaning they contain information related to how the plugin processed the event instead of information about the actual event. Those placeholders start with an underscore and can be seen in `/test` autocompletion when you start to type a placeholder beginning with an underscore. Internal placeholders can be used to determine things like the event type or current action, which can be useful in cases where that information is lost (custom placeholders, rate limiters). The following internal placeholders are usable:
- **_type**: The ID of the current streamlabs event.
- **_api_type**: The Streamlabs ID of the current event (only used in the Streamlabs API)
- **_action**: The ID of the current action, if available
- **_platform**: The platform on which the current event occured (either "streamlabs", "youtube" or "twitch")
- **_pl_count**: How many placeholders currently exist within this event
- **_pl_count_event**: How many placeholders currently exist within this event (excluding custom placeholders)

## Available Event Types

### streamlabs_donation
Triggered when someone donates money through **Streamlabs tipping**. This event type also works as a base for every other donation event, `amount` and `amount_double` have a different meaning depending on the event, `amount_formatted` will be empty in some cases, `currency` can either be a real currency, or something like "Bits" in other events.

**Placeholders**
- **amount**: The amount of money donated, without the decimal point (for example 2, 6, 10, 100, 10000)
- **amount_double**: The amount of money donated with the decimal point (for example 2.5, 6, 10, 100.7, 10000.54)
- **amount_formatted**: The amount of money, formatted with the currency (for example $20.4, 20.4â‚¬)
- **currency**: The currency of the donation (for example USD or EUR, for a full list, take a look at the [Streamlabs API Documentation](https://dev.streamlabs.com/docs/currency-codes))
- **message**: The message sent with the donation, if no such message exists, it stays empty.
